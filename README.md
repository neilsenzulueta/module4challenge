Timed coding quiz

## Description 

My motivation for this project was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions.  The web application will run in the browser and will feature updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code I've created.  I wanted to create a timed quiz that has a responsive user interface.  The timed quiz will consist of Javascript fundamentals that will allow users to store high scores data at the conclusion of the quiz.

## Installation 

"N/A"

## Usage

This webpage begins with a introduction to the timed coding quiz. User needs to click the button "start quiz", the quiz will start as the page will display a multiple choice question. Once the user picks an answer, the user will be presented with another question.  If a question is answered incorrectly, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the timer located on the top right corner of the page.  The quiz is over once all questions have been answered or when the timer reaches 0. User is able to save their initials when "save score" button is clicked.  User can view previous user scores by clicking "View highscore" button located on the top left corner of web page.
